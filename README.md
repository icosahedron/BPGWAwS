# Building the book "Building a Production Grade Web Application with Supabase"

So far up through Chapter 3. Includes the installation and UI shell using
Next.js

## Getting Started

The first chapter outlines installing all the necessary components, which are
of course, Next.js and Supabase.

Just doing npm install should be sufficient to get all the components installed,
and then `npm run dev` will start the server. `localhost:3000` and 
`localhost:3000/tickets` will show the UI so far.
